# SnakeGame-Java
Made entirely in Java

"The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult."

Main objective: Have fun, relax and try to eat as many apples with your snake as possible!

Controls: Snake moves on its own. Use Arrows keys on your keyboard (←↑→↓) to change direction of the movement.

Simple game created in Netbeans, Java.
